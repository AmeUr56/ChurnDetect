# Project
**ChurnDetect**: Predicting Customer Churn for Telecommunication Companies

# Purpose
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** to predict **customer churn**, enabling businesses to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

# Description
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry, impacting revenue and growth.
This project uses the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn">Telco Customer Churn dataset</a>, which contains customer demographic, account, and service information, to train a churn prediction model.
The model aims to identify customers likely to leave and suggest targeted interventions.

# Business Problem
Customer churn results in significant revenue loss and increased costs for acquiring new customers. The problem is:<pre>
How can we accurately predict which customers are likely to churn and why?</pre>

# Objectives
Analyze and explore the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
Preprocess and prepare data for machine learning.
Build and train machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Evaluate model performance and interpret results.
Deploy a practical solution for identifying and preventing churn.
